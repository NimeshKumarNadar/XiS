# XiS - Access at fingertips...

> XiS is an android application that provides direct access to various portals of NIT Trichy, such as Student Webmail, MIS, etc at a single platform accessible just at a fingertap.
> This application uses the WebView functionality to access the portals via url.
> It also leverages caching to store previous states, providing auto-login most of the times. Although, it does not alter any functionality of the original portal.
> XiS has potential to include many more portals as per requirement.
> XiS does not own any of the portals and does not interfere with their functionalities, it is just an interface providing direct link to those portals.

> All the copyrights of the acccessible portals belong to the respective Institution. Copyrights to the XiS android application belongs to creator - Nimesh Kumar Nadar, and thus, the application should not be used, distributed, and/or duplicated without his acknowledgement and permission.
